## Problem 1

### Read and clean the data
```{r}
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = as.factor(ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1))) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))) %>% 
  mutate(
    victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "White", "non-White"),
    victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "non-White")),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```
