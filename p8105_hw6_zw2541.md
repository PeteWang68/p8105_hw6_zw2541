Problem 1
---------

### Read and clean the data

``` r
homicides = read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    solved = as.factor(ifelse(disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest"), 0, 1))) %>% 
  filter(!(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))) %>% 
  mutate(
    victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "White", "non-White"),
    victim_race = factor(victim_race, levels = c("White", "non-White")),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

### Fit a logistic regression model

``` r
ml_baltimore =
  homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_sex + victim_race + victim_age, family = binomial, data = .)

ml_baltimore %>% 
  broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
         conf_low = exp(conf.low),
         conf_high = exp(conf.high)) %>% 
  select(term, odds_ratio, conf_low, conf_high) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-White") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                  |  odds\_ratio|  conf\_low|  conf\_high|
|:----------------------|------------:|----------:|-----------:|
| victim\_racenon-White |        0.441|      0.312|        0.62|

The estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims is 0.441 (keeping all other variables fixed), and the confidence interval is (0.312, 0.620).
